### mitsumori

- Would like to thank the owner of the [elm-shared-state](https://github.com/ohanhi/elm-shared-state) for pulling me out of the dregs of trying to wing shared state by myself.
- Uses Supabase rest API for auth related functions (Ports for the Sign in, Sign up, Session, Sign out), and uses the `elm-graphql` library to consume the remaining parts of Supabase API
- The folder `src/MitsumoriApi` is generated by the `elm-graphql` library
